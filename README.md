# budget-project
5-3-17
My first Java project, is a budget management program to view statistics on all of the expenses entered in for various time periods under various categories. 
I wanted something customized to how I think and like things organized.
As my first program with no formal coding background, I am now aware that putting all of your classes in one gigantic file is not recommended.
I still use this to keep track of all my expenses, although there are definitely some improvements to be made in future versions, when I re-make this in a more front-end language.


A new .data file is created on the user's desktop when the compiled program is first run. 
A user can add simple payments into the list (negatives do work!)
A user can select what category this payment will be under, or create a new one using the combo box.
A user can add a note about this payment, but there is currently no way to view said note later.
In the main frame, a user can select which category/categories they want to view, and hit refresh to see updated stats in the bottom panel.
A user can also select what date range they wish to view their stats in.
